There are three types of clauses-
1)GROUP BY 
2)HAVING
3) ORDER BY

SQL GROUP BY statement is used to arrange identical data into groups. The GROUP BY statement is used with the SQL SELECT statement.
The GROUP BY statement follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.
The GROUP BY statement is used with aggregation function


Syntax-

SELECT column  
FROM table_name  
WHERE conditions   
GROUP BY column  
ORDER BY column  
EG-

SELECT COMPANY, COUNT(*)  
FROM PRODUCT_MAST   
GROUP BY COMPANY;  .





2. HAVING
HAVING clause is used to specify a search condition for a group or an aggregate.
Having is used in a GROUP BY clause. If you are not using GROUP BY clause then you can use HAVING function like a WHERE clause.
Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2   
FROM table_name  
WHERE conditions   
GROUP BY column1, column2   
HAVING conditions  
ORDER BY column1, column2;  
Example:

SELECT COMPANY, COUNT(*)  
FROM PRODUCT_MAST   
GROUP BY COMPANY  
HAVING COUNT(*)>2;  




3. ORDER BY
The ORDER BY clause sorts the result-set in ascending or descending order.
It sorts the records in ascending order by default. DESC keyword is used to sort the records in descending order.
Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition  
ORDER BY column1, column2... ASC|DESC;
